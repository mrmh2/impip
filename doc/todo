 ST1: Store and restore pipeline
TARGET: Saving and loading pipelines and data structures/units

TODO: Proper metadata record
TODO: METHOD: pipeline print/display
TODO: Create dunits when running pipeline

TODO: Filter subprocesses that exit with non-0 statuses shouldn't then copy files
TODO: Reorganise utility programs
TODO: Easier pipeline testing
TODO: Process stages should have function that returns name for next data stage
TODO: Think about data structures

DONE: Dataset class (which should take some of pipeline's current functionality)
DONE: Separate data units in separate areas
DONE: Smart loading of pipeline stage modules
DONE: (sort of) Better printing/logging
DONE: Multiple processing stages per data stage, multiple data stages per processing stage
DONE: Multiple inputs for an output
DONE: GetLnumbers pipeline stage
